## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. Clone the Git Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/KaushikKannanB/git
```
- This command downloads the repository from GitHub to the local machine.
- The repository is cloned into a folder named `git` in the current directory.

### 2. Navigate to the Cloned Repository
```sh
cd git
```
- Moves into the `git` directory where the repository was cloned.

### 3. Create a New Directory
```sh
mkdir task22
```
- Creates a new directory named `task22` inside the repository.

### 4. Navigate into the New Directory
```sh
cd task22
```
- Moves into the `task22` directory.

### 5. Create an Empty File for Tracking Empty Folders
```sh
echo >.gitkeep
```
- The `.gitkeep` file is used to ensure Git tracks empty folders since Git does not track empty directories by default.

### 6. Move Back to the Repository Root
```sh
cd..
```
- Moves back to the `git` directory.

### 7. Add the `.gitkeep` File to Git
```sh
git add task22/.gitkeep
```
- Stages the `.gitkeep` file to be committed.

### 8. Commit the `.gitkeep` File
```sh
git commit -m "Added task22 with gitkeep"
```
- Commits the `.gitkeep` file with a message.

### 9. Push the Changes to GitHub
```sh
git push origin main
```
- Pushes the committed changes to the `main` branch on GitHub.

### 10. Create a Dummy Text File
```sh
echo K>c.txt
```
- Creates a new text file named `c.txt` with `K` as its content.

### 11. Check the Status of the Repository
```sh
git status
```
- Displays the current state of the repository.
- `c.txt` appears as an untracked file.

### 12. Create an Empty `.gitignore` File
```sh
echo >.gitignore
```
- Creates an empty `.gitignore` file, which is used to specify files that Git should ignore.

### 13. Check Git Status Again
```sh
git status
```
- Shows that both `.gitignore` and `c.txt` are untracked files.

### 14. Add `c.txt` to `.gitignore`
```sh
echo c.txt>.gitignore
```
- Adds `c.txt` to `.gitignore` so that Git will ignore it.

### 15. Check Git Status Again
```sh
git status
```
- `c.txt` is now ignored by Git.
- `.gitignore` is still untracked.

### 16. Add `.gitignore` to Git
```sh
git add .gitignore
```
- Stages the `.gitignore` file for commit.

### 17. Commit the `.gitignore` File
```sh
git commit -m "Ignored again"
```
- Commits the `.gitignore` file with a message.

### 18. Push the Changes to GitHub
```sh
git push origin main
```
- Pushes the committed changes to the `main` branch on GitHub.
